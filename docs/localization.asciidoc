Introduced in version 6.7 Localization allows you to change the language in {kib}.

Kibana currently supports the following locales:
* English - `en` (default)
* Chinese - `zh-CN`

We will be supporting -many- more locales in the near future! See <<>> for instructions on how to configure {kib} for setting locale. For localizing your plugin or contributing to {kib} i18n see <<development-plugin-localization>>.
